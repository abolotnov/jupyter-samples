Although my minimum monthly payments average about $170 per month, I pay roughly $2000 to $2300 every month with extra money left over.  I accrued some medical debt within the last two years.  <br><br>I used my credit cards to cover the medical expenses my insurance didn't cover.  I am in excellent condition now.  I am slightly surprised about the score Transunion gave me.  I have been running my three credit reports and scores monthly through Experian for the last year and my score always averages 725 - 739 for all three Credit Reporting Agencies.  When checking my credit report directly through Transunion, my score was lower.  <br><br>I am in the process of consolidating my student loans.  The consolidation should be complete by the end of December.  I am consolidating them, not for payment reasons, but to increase my credit score with less installment accounts showing on my credit report.  The student  loan payment is $161 per month and in good standing.  Consolidating the installments/loans will increase my credit score by approximately 15 points. <br>","credit_card","Credit Card Consolidation","941xx","CA","21.01","0","May-1992","2","39","","14","0","21366","44.9%","18","f","0.00","0.00","12161.905553296","12161.91","9800.00","2361.91","0.0","0.0","0.0","Jan-2014","3866.0","","Feb-2017","0","","1","Individual","","","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cash","N","","","","","",""

To pay off an old loan with an unfavourably high APR of 24.99%. The payoff amount for this loan is $4,039 (as of 12/22/11, the date this loan would potentially fund).<br><br>2. For home repairs. My condo received some water damage during Hurricane Irene, which was worsened by rain storms during the following months. The entire building was affected and the condo board is co-ordinating repairs to finish in Spring 2012, but in order to cover the costs of this, each unit owner is requested to pay a special assessment in January 2012. My share of this is $4,164.<br><br>3. The remainder of the loan is to finance home improvements which I plan to coincide with the repairs in order to take advantage of the contractors already being there, and save some money. I plan to add a room and upgrade my rusting old boiler for an on-demand one to be more energy efficient. Quotes I've received for this range from $4,000-$5,000, so the total loan amount leaves a little buffer in case of unforeseen extra costs during the work, which is usually the case when dealing with contractors!<br><br>I am an executive with a very stable job for a company that is well-insulated from the economic problems.

I still would like to have the $7600.00 indicated in my account. The purpose of the loan is to procure added product and to help with small expansion at my greenhouse. I have a rotating account that provides enough for my normal expenses but would like to have additional funds for the year. Beginning January 1, 2012 I will start propagating our seeds and will grow the plants until April when we will open our store and start our selling season. During April, May, and June I sell 60k +. At the end of the season I pay back the loans I accumulate. I will have four employees working until the end of June or until we sell out. I appreciate the current investors and hope that I can reach my goal of the full loan amount. <br><br>Sincere Thanks<br><br><br> Borrower added on 12/14/11 > Recently an investor requested that I answer a question but when I follow the link log into the account and come to the question page there is no question posted.

While the numbers crunch out to a D2 loan, let me take you beyond the numbers and show you how this is not your typical D2 loan.  The funds from this loan will be used strictly to pay down debts which carry significantly higher interest rates.  I experienced some life events in the past that caused the current situation.  I have worked hard to improve credit score and pay down the debts but with the interest rates so high its a real struggle.  I have been employed for 15 years with the same company (Fortune 50) so I have a stable work history.  As a result of my steady work history, I do not miss a payment which is one of the reasons why I qualify for this loan.  My current budget for debt repayment is $1,300 and this loan will reduce that to about $800 which will free up much needed cash to pay down the remainder of my debt faster and ensure that I provide you the return on your investment as agreed.  I am a good borrower because I have a steady history of paying my bills on time, very stable work history, clearly can afford the payments and I much rather pay you the not-so-great interest of 17% than to pay a greedy, unscrupulous giant credit card company.  You make money, I save money and credit card companies lose money. win-win!""","debt_consolidation","Consolidation","641xx","MO","4.96","0","Dec-1995","3","","","6","0","10984","84.5%","9","f","0.00","0.00","18494.3499554904","18458.78","13000.00","5494.35","0.0","0.0","0.0","Apr-2015","5992.22","","Feb-2018","0","","1","Individual","","","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cash","N","","","","","",""
